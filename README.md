# Robotics Specialization
---

This repository contains my solution code to the assignments and capstone project of all the modules to complete the Robotics Specialization by University of Pennsylvania.
PS: These codes are for my future reference, and it is advised to take heed on the Coursera Honor Code.

Modules are divided into:

* [Robotics: Estimation and Learning](https://github.com/smit585/Upenn-Robotics/tree/master/Robotics%20and%20Estimation)
    * Introduction to MATLAB and tools to sample from Single or Multivariate Gaussians. Week 1 Assignment required to Estimate and Target the Color in Dataset

</p>
    * Introduced to Kalman Filter and Maximum-A-Posterior Estimation. Week 2 Assignment required to track the ball in 2D space
    *  Week 3 introduces us to Mapping and crucial aspects of Localization. In Week 3 Assignment, we build an Occupancy Grid Map, that reads the Lidar Data off a Bot and using log loss data, designates certaininty to a discretized map. Darker the map -> Higher the Certainity of Free space.

</p>
    * The final week wraps up the course by discussing about Particle filtering, a modified version of Unscented Kalman Filter. The Capstone project requires usage of Particle Filter to estimate the best Pose of Robot in accordance to the correlation of Lidar and Groundtruth Map Data.
